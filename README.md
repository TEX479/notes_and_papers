# notes_and_papers
general purpose repo for storing and forwarding .md-files and other project-files to people (or me)\
NOTE: if you found this repo in the outskirts of the internet, don't bother searching all the files. if you *do* look through the files *and* find something you needed, just use it. but please tell me, cuz i would be amazed if that where to happen
